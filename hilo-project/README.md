Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Draw a card. Guess if the next card you draw is higher or lower than the last card. If you are correct, then you win 100 points, but if you are wrong, you lose 75 points.You can keep playing for as long as you like, but if you reach 0 points you can no longer play.
